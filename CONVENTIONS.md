# Patchline Automation Project ‚Äì Coding Conventions

## üè∑Ô∏è Naming Conventions

Please follow these conventions for **all code in this project**, regardless of language:

- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Properties:** `PascalCase`
- **Events:** `PascalCase`
- **Fields (Variables):** `camelCase`
- **Function Names:** `PascalCase`
- **Function Parameters:** `camelCase`
- **Classes:** `PascalCase`

**Note:**  
These conventions are inspired by C# practices and are used here for cross-language consistency, even in Python.  
If contributing, **ignore standard Python ‚Äúsnake_case‚Äù style and follow these project-specific conventions.**

## üß† Coding Principles

- **KISS:** Keep It Simple, Stupid‚Äîwrite clear, minimal, and direct code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **SOLID Principles:** Ensure code is modular, single-responsibility, easily extendable, and loosely coupled.
- **Centralized Configuration:**  
  - No hardcoded paths or drive letters (except `C:` for Gemini CLI editing).
  - Use config files or environment variables for all paths and settings.
- **Archiving, Not Deleting:**  
  - Move obsolete or unused scripts to the `archive/` folder rather than deleting.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Docstrings and comments should be clear, concise, and describe all public APIs and major functions.
- **Modularity:**  
  - Scripts and modules should be reusable, portable, and organized for clarity.

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory & Workflow Policy

- **Editing/Refactoring (Gemini CLI):** Only use absolute paths on the `C:` drive.
- **Testing/Project/Models:** Use config to reference models/assets, which may reside on any drive.
- **.gitignore:** Keep large model files, outputs, and irrelevant assets out of version control.

*Stick to these conventions to ensure a consistent, maintainable, and professional codebase across the whole Patchline project!*
