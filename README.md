# üß∞ Kalponic Studio Toolbox üß∞

**A collection of my working scripts, project experiments, and automation tools.**

---

## What is this?

This is my public ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù where I (Moinuddin Ahmed / Kalponic Studio/Kalponic Games) drop all sorts of scripts and prototypes:
- Local AI model launchers & automation
- Unity workflow scripts & batch tools
- Asset pipeline helpers (Blender, Krita, etc.)
- Random experiments, one-off utilities, and more

**Some are AI-powered, some are not!  
Some are rough drafts, others are more polished. You can use it at your own risk.**

## Structure

- `/apps/` ‚Äì Each project/tool in its folder (with README if needed)
- `/assets/` ‚Äì Icons, screenshots, textures, etc.
- `/docs/` ‚Äì Guides, notes, or setup instructions
- New folders and scripts will appear as I build new things!

## Apps & Plugins (what's in this repo)

Below is a quick, auto-generated table of contents linking to each app or plugin README (when present), plus a one-line summary for every top-level app. If an app had no README I generated a short summary by scanning its main script.

If you'd like, I can turn this into a separate `APPS_TOC.md` or insert anchors and badges. I also scanned app folders that lacked READMEs and generated the short summaries above from their main scripts.
