# üß∞ Kalponic Studio Toolbox üß∞

**A collection of my working scripts, project experiments, and automation tools.**

---

## What is this?

This is my public ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù where I (Moinuddin / Kalponic Studio/Kalponic Games) drop all sorts of scripts and prototypes:
- Local AI model launchers & automation
- Unity workflow scripts & batch tools
- Asset pipeline helpers (Blender, Krita, etc.)
- Random experiments, one-off utilities, and more

**Some are AI-powered, some are not!  
Some are rough drafts, others are more polished. Use at your own risk.**

---

## Structure

- `/apps/` ‚Äì Each project/tool in its folder (with README if needed)
- `/assets/` ‚Äì Icons, screenshots, textures, etc.
- `/docs/` ‚Äì Guides, notes, or setup instructions
- New folders and scripts will appear as I build new things!

---

## Why share this?

I‚Äôm sharing my ‚Äúwork-in-progress‚Äù code and ideas so that:
- Others can learn or adapt what I‚Äôm building
- I can get feedback or help
- It might inspire someone else‚Äôs workflow or project
