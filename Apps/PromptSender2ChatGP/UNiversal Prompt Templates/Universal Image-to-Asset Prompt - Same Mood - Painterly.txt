"Inspect the reference image and recreate the object as a 2D stylised asset in anime cel-shading blended with painterly art, leaning toward a soft, 
hand-painted finish. Preserve the subject type (e.g., a pot remains a pot, a tree remains a tree) and respect the mood, colours, and theme from the source image. 
Reinterpret the form and details so it looks original and not identical, like a new version of the same object. Use clean, readable shapes with painterly textures, 
soft brushwork, and smooth gradients.((No Outlines)), Avoid flat fills or heavy outlines. Apply subtle wear, moss, or weathering only if naturally suggested by the source. 
Game-ready, 1024×1024. Render on a flat mid-grey (#808080) background for easy removal. Respect the camera angle and perspective shown in the source image. 
Do not alter the viewpoint or rotation — match the source image’s orientation so it aligns seamlessly with other in-game assets."
