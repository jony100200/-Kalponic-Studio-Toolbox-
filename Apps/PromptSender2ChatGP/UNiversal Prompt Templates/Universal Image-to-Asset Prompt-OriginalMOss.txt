"Convert this image into a 2D stylized asset in anime cel-shading mixed with painterly art. Clean, readable shapes, sharp light/shadow edges, soft hand-painted gradients, warm natural colors. Subtle wear, moss, and imperfections for organic realism. Ghibli-inspired cozy fantasy style, game-ready, 1024×1024. Render on a transparent background. If transparency is not possible, use a flat mid-gray background (#808080) for easy removal. Respect the camera angle and perspective shown in the source image. Do not alter the viewpoint or rotation — match the source image’s orientation so it aligns seamlessly with other in-game assets."
