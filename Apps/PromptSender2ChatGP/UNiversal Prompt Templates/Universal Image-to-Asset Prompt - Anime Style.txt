Inspect this image and recreate the object as a 2D stylized asset in anime cel-shading mixed with painterly art. Preserve the subject type (e.g., a pot remains a pot) and respect the mood, colors, and theme shown in the source image. Reinterpret the form and details so it looks original and not identical — like a different version of the same object. Use clean, readable shapes, sharp light/shadow edges, and soft hand-painted gradients. Apply subtle, natural surface variations only where appropriate.((No Outlines)) Game-ready,. Render on a flat mid-gray (#808080) background for easy removal. Respect the camera angle and perspective shown in the source image. Do not alter the viewpoint or rotation — match the source image’s orientation so it aligns seamlessly with other in-game assets.
