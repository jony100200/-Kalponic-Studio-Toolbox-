Inspect the reference image and recreate the object as a 2D stylised asset that combines a low-poly, faceted look with anime-style cel-shading and a soft, painterly finish.
Preserve the subject type (e.g., a pot remains a pot, a tree remains a tree) and keep the overall mood, colours, and theme of the source.

Reinterpret the form and details so the result feels like a new, original version — not an identical copy — while keeping clear, readable shapes and visible low-poly facets.((No Outlines))

Apply cel-shaded lighting with crisp but soft-edged highlights and shadows, then blend with hand-painted textures and smooth gradients for depth. Avoid harsh outlines or flat fills. Add subtle wear, weathering, or moss only if it feels natural.

Keep the exact camera angle and perspective shown in the reference render (whether isometric,orthographic, 3/4, or other). Do not rotate or change the viewpoint.

Final output should be game-ready , rendered on a flat mid-grey background (#808080) for easy removal.
