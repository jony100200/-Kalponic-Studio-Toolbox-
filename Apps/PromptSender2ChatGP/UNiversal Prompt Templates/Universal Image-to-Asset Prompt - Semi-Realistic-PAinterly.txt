``"Create a 2D stylized game asset in semi-painterly style. Use clean, readable forms with subtle outlines, soft cel-shading blended with painterly gradients, and light brush texture for an organic feel. 
Surfaces should avoid flat fills or photorealistic detail. Keep colors natural with mild tonal variation, adjusting palette to match the mood (cozy, dark, sci-fi, etc.). Consistent semi-painterly stylization, 1024×1024. 
Render on a flat mid-gray (#808080) background for easy removal. Respect the camera angle and perspective shown in the source image. Do not alter the viewpoint or rotation — match the source image’s orientation so it 
aligns seamlessly with other in-game assets."
