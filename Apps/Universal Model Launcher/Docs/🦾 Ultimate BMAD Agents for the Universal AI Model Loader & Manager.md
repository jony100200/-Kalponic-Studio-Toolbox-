### **Agent: Backend Engineer \+ Plugin Architect**

**Prompt:**

**"Act as a Senior Python Backend Engineer and Plugin Architect.**

1. **Implement dynamic model loaders for GGUF (llama.cpp/KoboldCpp), Hugging Face Transformers, Whisper, TTS, etc.**

2. **Use a plugin/extension system to make adding new types easy.**

3. **Provide base loader class/interface, and at least one example for each supported type.**

4. **Output code, with comments on extensibility."**

**Why:**

* **This makes your app future-proof (easy to add new model types).**

---

## **STEP 5: API Layer (FastAPI)**

### **Agent: API & Integration Engineer**

**Prompt:**

**"Act as an API & Integration Engineer.**

1. **Using this backend: \[PASTE RELEVANT CODE\],**

2. **Build FastAPI endpoints for: load/unload model, query status, send inference, manage plugins, view resource stats, get logs.**

3. **Ensure endpoints are async, documented, and secure (optional API key).**

4. **Provide OpenAPI schema and sample client usage."**

**Why:**

* **The API is how all your pipeline apps communicate with the manager.**

---

## **STEP 6: Minimal Dashboard UI (Optional)**

### **Agent: Frontend/UI Engineer**

**Prompt:**

**"Act as a Frontend/UI Engineer.**

1. **Using the API: \[PASTE API DOC\],**

2. **Build a minimal dashboard (Tkinter/Gradio/web) showing: model list/status, load/unload, resource gauges, error log.**

3. **Must be modular, clean, and show live updates."**

**Why:**

* **This lets you monitor everything visually; great for debugging and daily ops.**

---

## **STEP 7: Testing & QA**

### **Agent: QA/Testing Engineer**

**Prompt:**

**"Act as a QA & Test Engineer.**  
 **For each module: \[PASTE MODULE CODE\],**

1. **Write comprehensive unit tests for normal and edge cases.**

2. **For full app: Write integration tests for loading/unloading, resource overflow, plugin loading, API errors.**

3. **Provide a coverage report and known issue list."**

**Why:**

* **Prevents silent failures, future regressions, and lets you ship with confidence.**

---

## **STEP 8: Documentation & Dev Guide**

1. **Write a professional README: overview, install/run, API, plugin guide, FAQ, troubleshooting.**

2. **Add code comments/docstrings.**

3. **Make docs accessible for new users and easy to extend for future devs."**

**Why:**

* **Makes onboarding, usage, extension, and troubleshooting simple for you (and anyone else).**

---

# **üèÜ How Does This Actually Play Out?**

1. **Start with your overall spec:**  
    **Hand it to the Product Manager/Architect agent‚Äîget your ‚Äúblueprint.‚Äù**

2. **For each module in the plan:**

   * **Give the agent *that module‚Äôs* prompt.**

   * **Feed the *output* to the next agent (e.g., from Backend Engineer to QA Engineer for tests).**

   * **If a module is complex (e.g., Model Loader), use both Backend and Plugin Architect agents for a hybrid approach.**

3. **Iterate:**  
    **After QA tests, if bugs are found, *copy the error/test back to the appropriate agent to fix*.**

4. **Integrate everything, then run the Documentation agent to wrap it all up.**

---

## **Why This Works:**

* **Each agent is laser-focused on their discipline, so the AI ‚Äúthinks‚Äù like an expert team, not a generalist.**

* **Context is always tight: Each step only gets what‚Äôs needed, not the full messy project at once.**

* **You‚Äôre in control: You direct the ‚Äúteam,‚Äù maintaining quality and progress, just like a real tech lead.**
