Brief:
# KS PDF Studio v2 — Execution Brief

Implement the KS PDF Studio vision as a modular Python desktop tool focused on tutorial creators.

## Core Objectives
- Reuse existing extraction strengths and add high-quality PDF creation.
- Keep architecture modular: extraction, creation, AI, GUI, templates, QA.
- Prioritize practical output: runnable modules, clear docs, and launch-ready packaging.

## Required Outcomes
1. Architecture plan and module map.
2. Implementation task breakdown with milestones.
3. Initial scaffold instructions and file structure.
4. Validation checklist for performance, quality, and UX.
5. Packaging and go-to-market checklist for first release.

## Constraints
- Stack: Python, ReportLab, markdown, CustomTkinter, optional local transformers.
- Performance targets: PDF generation < 5s for 50-page tutorial, AI response < 10s, memory < 1GB.
- Keep features practical and incremental; avoid over-engineering.
- Every output should be implementation-ready and include clear next actions.
