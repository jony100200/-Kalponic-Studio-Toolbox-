Here are some concrete recommendations to help you redesign the KS Seamless Checker as a polished stand‑alone PySide/Qt application.  They draw on general UI/UX research as well as dark‑theme guidelines and Qt styling resources.

### 1. Colour harmony and theme

* **Choose a restrained dark palette**.  Dark backgrounds reduce eye strain and feel modern, but they work best when paired with muted tones and subtle accents.  A 2024 dark‑mode guide notes that for dark UIs you should use *subdued colours* for most surfaces and reserve brighter hues as highlights.  Avoid pure black; deep charcoal (e.g. `#19232D` or `#262E38`) with slightly lighter panels provides enough separation.
* **Ensure sufficient contrast**.  The same guide recommends a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for large headlines.  Use off‑white or light grey (`#D9D8D8`) for text on dark panels, and ensure buttons stand out with a difference of at least 20 in the brightness scale.
* **Use a consistent accent colour**.  Pick a single accent colour (e.g. teal or blue) for action buttons and highlighted states.  Apply it sparingly to avoid visual noise.  QDarkStyle’s colour system can help you select harmonised shades of blue or grey and adjust them systematically.
* **Consider an existing Qt dark theme**.  Libraries like **QDarkStyle** or **PyQtDarkTheme** provide professionally tuned dark style sheets for PySide and can be loaded with one line of code.  They give you a consistent base palette and widget styling that you can customise.

### 2. Layout improvements

* **Top bar**: Move the “KS Seamless Checker” title into a minimal header bar with just the window controls (close, minimise) on the right.  Remove the default OS window frame entirely (set `Qt.FramelessWindowHint`), which eliminates the white border and allows you to match the dark theme.
* **Folder selection and batch controls**: Group the folder path entry, “Browse…” button, and “Process Batch” action together at the top left.  A single horizontal stack with labelled icons can reduce clutter and guide the user through the workflow.
* **Axis options**: Instead of a separate “Process Batch” button for each axis, use a segmented button or checkbox group labelled “Check on: X | Y | Both”.  This keeps options visible without crowding the main area.
* **Results vs. Preview**: Dedicate the centre of the window to a scrollable list or table of results.  Each row could display the image name, X/Y/seamless status, and a small thumbnail.  Place a larger “Preview” pane to the right that updates when the user clicks a row, showing the selected image with optional overlays and zoom controls.
* **Status and export**: Add a slim footer bar for progress and log messages.  Place the “Export CSV” button here or near the results pane, aligned to the right, so it’s available once processing finishes.
* **Visual calmness**: Blender’s human‑interface guidelines emphasise avoiding strong colours and large layout shifts.  Use consistent margins and spacing throughout, and avoid sudden pop‑ups; instead, gently reveal additional options when needed.

### 3. Typography and icons

* Use a single sans‑serif typeface at sizes that favour legibility; lighten the font colour slightly for less important labels and use bold weight to highlight the primary actions.  Dark‑mode guidelines suggest increasing font size and weight to improve legibility on dark backgrounds.
* Add icons to buttons and segmented controls (e.g. folder icon for “Browse”, play icon for “Process Batch”) to reinforce meaning.  Keep icons monochrome or tinted with your accent colour.

### 4. Implementation notes

* Load a dark style sheet on your QApplication start (e.g. `app.setStyleSheet(qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet_pyside6())`) to apply the base theme across widgets.
* For a frameless window, enable window dragging by intercepting mouse events on the header bar.
* Use QSplitter or QHBoxLayout for resizable panels; allow the user to adjust the width of the results list and preview pane to suit their workflow.

By adopting a coherent dark palette with sufficient contrast, organising controls into logical groups and panels, and eliminating the bright OS frame, your seamless checker will look more professional and easier to use.
